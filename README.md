--------------

This is my first time using React and its ecosystem.

### Extras I would like to work on:

* Redux and state management
* Service workers, offline mode and local storage.
* More advanced features such as search, larger images or zoom, fast image selection, etc.
* Better testing practices. Explore snapshot testing, coverage testing.
* Using component repositories such as Bit or Storybook. 

### Technologies and Libraries used:

* React Apollo was used as the library to create GraphQL queries and fetch the images and their data.
* Jest was the testing framework used to run tests.
* React Toastify was a library used to display toaster messages.
* Create React App was used to bootstrap the project.
* react-styleguidist to create documentation.
